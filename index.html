							<p>Well, I don't have a gaming channel on youtube!!, Do I need so?. As I said I love playing games, My longest hour for playing game is 9hrs!!. Yes, 9 hours I played  games without getting up from my seat. Mostly I like to play action adventure games (story mode). So far I have played GTA 5, FARCRY 5, ASSASSIN'S CREED ODYSSEY, TOM CLANCY'S GHOST RECON WILDLANDS, BATTLEFIELD 5, MIRROR'S EDGE, NFS: MOST WANTED 2012, MASS EFFECT: ANDROMEDA.</p>			<br>
									<p>Hmm... it's looking like I have played only a few games, Right?. Well I started playing games from 2019 before that I didn't  my own laptop and now I got my Dell G3. I can't say that it's a fully functionable gaming laptop but still I'm able to manage to play games on it. Here you might have got a doubt that how was I able to manage to buy these many games? - I didn't buy these games nor borrowed from anyone, I just downloaded pirated version from internet. Where in internet? - Fitgirl Repacks, RG Mechanics.</p>

Well I don't do that, I do give some touch up's to my picture's as you know all the click's won't be perfect. I just remove unnecessary from background, If so needed I add up some effects such as shades, sunlight, etc..</p>
							<p>From how long am I doing this editing in photoshop? - since from the time I started photography in 2013.</p>

								<p>Here is my favorite part. I'm very much interested in robotics, My dream ambition is to make a human robot which exactly thinks like a human. Well, I'm not gonna make a robot which replace's human's race - I just want to make a robot which makes man kind easier not more than that.</p>
							<p>My mother always use to say me that when I was a small kid - I use to play with remote controlled toys which I used to break it in 2 - 3 days from the day I brought it from store..., Who doesn't do that? - everyone does it in their childhood but I'm a little different I use to break it because I was very curious to know that  "how does this work?", this lead me to study about robotics. From my childhood I was very interested in these things as well as technology....</p>
							<p>As I said I'm very curious to study robotics, this made a interest in me to learn programming / AI & ML nothing more than that. </p>
